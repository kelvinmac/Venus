The Mono binding bits are all in proprietary Unity C++ of course, but there's nothing stopping a C# application from building other C# assemblies. Unity is doing, roughly:

detecting a change to source

recompiling the assemblies to a temporary location

serializing the current editor state to a temporary store

unloading the currently loaded assemblies

copying the new assemblies over the old ones

loading the new assemblies

deserializing the editor state from the temporary store

cleanup
